description: Get your Lumo server running in minutes
---

Get your Lumo Minecraft server up and running with a single command.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- At least 4GB of available RAM
- Port 25565 available (Minecraft default port)

## Run the Server

The simplest way to start the server:

```bash
docker run -e EULA=true -p 25565:25565 ghcr.io/lucasilverentand/lumo-server:latest
```

:::note
By setting `EULA=true`, you are agreeing to the [Minecraft EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula).
:::

This command will:
1. Pull the latest Lumo server image from GitHub Container Registry
2. Start the Paper server with default settings (4GB RAM)
3. Create 5 worlds automatically (hub, wilds, nether, end, city)
4. Load all 20+ plugins
5. Enable autopause to save resources when idle

## Connect to Your Server

1. Open Minecraft Java Edition (version 1.21.10)
2. Go to Multiplayer → Add Server
3. Enter:
   - **Server Name**: Lumo Server (or any name you like)
   - **Server Address**: `localhost:25565` (or your server's IP)
4. Click Done and connect!

You'll spawn in the hub world. Use `/mv tp lumo_wilds` to teleport to the survival world.

## First Login

When you first connect:

1. You'll be an operator (op) automatically if you're the first player
2. The server has pre-configured worlds ready to explore
3. Check out `/spawn` for the hub area
4. Use `/mv list` to see all available worlds

## Next Steps

Your server is now running, but data is temporary. To persist your worlds and configure features:

- [Docker Setup](/lumo-server/getting-started/docker/) - Add persistence, configure memory, enable backups
- [Environment Variables](/lumo-server/configuration/environment/) - Customize server settings
- [Automated Backups](/lumo-server/features/backups/) - Set up automated backups to S3 or local storage

## Stop the Server

To stop the server gracefully:

```bash
# Find your container ID
docker ps

# Stop the server (allows it to save worlds)
docker stop <container-id>
```

:::caution
Without volume mounting, your worlds will be lost when the container stops. See [Docker Setup](/lumo-server/getting-started/docker/) to add persistence.

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start?**
- Check Docker logs: `docker logs <container-id>`
- Verify port 25565 is not in use: `lsof -i :25565` (Mac/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :25565` (Windows)
- Ensure EULA is accepted: `-e EULA=true`

**Can't connect?**
- Verify the server is running: `docker ps`
- Check firewall allows port 25565
- If using a remote server, use its public IP instead of `localhost`

**Server is laggy?**
- Increase memory: `-e MEMORY=6G` (default is 4G)
- Disable autopause if issues: `-e ENABLE_AUTOPAUSE=false`
